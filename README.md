# Pong_Python

Pong is a very famous and very basic game. I decided it be a good easy project to build it all on my own. 
Just copy the code files in a linkable manner, and give it a go! It's quite fun; no wonder people obsessed over it back in the ancient times!
My code may be messy BUT I did it all myself and I'm only just learning python (in a serious manner) so I mean give me a break right?
